    "## The Importance of Joins in SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL join clause is used to combine records from two or more tables in a database. Why might that be useful/important? Well imagine a customer database. In the simplest possible implementation it might just have a single `customers` table with fields for `first_name`, `last_name` and `email`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, though you might want to store more information about your customers. Perhaps you need to mail them something. In that case, you'll want to store a mailing address in the database. Perhaps we could add `address_1`, `address_2`, `city`, `state` and `zip` fields *(assuming all of our customers are US based)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "That works, but what happens when a user changes their mailing address? We could just update the values contained in the fields, but now we're losing data. For example, if I was to ask \"where did we mail their order 4 months ago\" we wouldn't know by looking at the database because it's possible that we updated the mailing address fields some time in the last four months. And what if we need a billing address for them? Or to provide them with an address book so they can decide whether they want things mailed to their home, work or the hotel they're traveling to?\n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious answer to all of this is that instead of adding the address to the `customers` table, we'd probably be better creating a whole new `addresses` table. But the question then becomes ***\"how do we know which customer a given address belongs to?*** And that is where joins come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joins are the primary mechanism for combining data from multiple tables. In order to do this, you define the common attribute(s) between tables in order for them to be combined.\n",
